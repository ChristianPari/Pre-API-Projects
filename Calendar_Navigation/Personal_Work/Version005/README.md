In this version:
* I added more functionallity that will allow the user to not only change dates by way of SELECTs but also via BUTTONs.
* User can go through and select a specific year then month then day and the date will update for each option so that they can click the close BUTTON (red X BUTTON) and then create a note, or just by clicking through the month day year buttons to navigate through them indiviuadlly.
* Notes are stored in an OBJECT with KEYS being each specific date and having a value of an array of notes created by the user.
* Each note that is created is added to that array and displayed via an asterik as a new note within the same days DIV.
* Each date within the notes section is a HEADING element and then is followed by individual PARAGRAPH elements.
* Used CSS styling to give the display a widget-like feel using BOX SHADOWING and TRANSISTIONS / TRANSITION-DELAY w/ OPACTICTY and the size of the ELEMENTS.
