This version will consist of a main heading that displays the date, a button below that allows the user to changed the date by select elements if they want, another button that allows the user to make a note for that date and then (maybe either have the note appear below or in like a side column? or maybe there is a button below or next to the previous buttons that allow the user to reveal/show the notes below like a toggle?).
