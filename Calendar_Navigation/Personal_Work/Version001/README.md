Class assigned project
1) Classwork folder is full of updated class assignments to develope the calendar
2) Personal folder is used by me to develope the calendar project on my own on the side

*   This is version 1, this Calendar functions through buttons that have on-click methods attributed to them
    that allow the user to cycle through dates. Code logic used to ensure that a user cannot come across any
    `fake dates` such as Febuary 30th or 31st and so on
