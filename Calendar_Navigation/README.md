Class assigned project
1) Classwork folder is full of updated class assignments to develope the calendar
2) Personal folder is used by me to develope the calendar project on my own on the side

*   This is version 2, this Calendar functions by way of select elements that allow the user to have a drop down menu
    and select dates in order of YEAR then MONTH then DAY. Code logic used to ensure that a user cannot come across any
    `fake dates` such as Febuary 30th or 31st and so on
