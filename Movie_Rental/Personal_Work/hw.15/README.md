Version 1: A simple layout, user scrolls from top of webpage to bottom to view movies, although user can only "rent a random movie" by way of the button located at the top of the webpage. This program simply removes a movie from the available ones and pushes it into the rented ones. This was before I knew how to update the front-end.
