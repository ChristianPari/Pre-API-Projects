This will contain my personal and class projects for the year 2020:
* Movie Rental
    - This was a class assigned project up to a certain point and then we were sent on our own to advance it and make it our own through functionallity and styling.
    - The idea behind this project was to create a UI that allows a user to simply rent and return movies. There was no implemention of 'purchasing', simply just transfering data within JS and having it be display on the DOM.
    - My most recent version can be found <a href='https://github.com/ChristianPari/Projects-2020/tree/master/Movie_Rental/Personal_Work/Version003'>here</a>. I implmeneted scrollable DIVs on the y-axis for available and unavailable movies, along with each movie having its own DIV, CSS styling to create some cool animations, and a sidebar that can also be used to select movies to rent or return.
