This folder consists of my first attempts and walkthroughs learning about XHR.

I use a 'GET' request to receieve data from GitHub's API and made elements to then display user info to the DOM.
Both programs are slightly different but both consist of making the user's username a heading element, display the user's profile picture, a href link that brings you to the user's GitHub profile
