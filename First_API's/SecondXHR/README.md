This folder consists of my second attempt at XHR but this time i used JSON.Placeholder/users API to GET information

After using the GET request, I used the data to create seperate divs for each users information. 
I created multiple lines of heading elements to display different types of information like Company Name, Owner Name, Contact Information, ect. and also included a HREF link to thier website. 
Created some CSS just to help see all the information being displayed in a neat fashion, nothing crazy.
