This is my third attempt at using an API to GET information on users and display their information on the DOM.

Created a DIV within the body to then assign the DIVs created for each user that'll display each of their data neatly.
Each DIV has the user's:
- username
- profile pic
- a LINK to their GitHub
- a BUTTON to display more information on that user like:
    - followers
    - following
    - number of GitHub Repos they have
- followed by a second BUTTON that appears after the first is clicked that will hide the information and then the 'show' BUTTON will be displayed again for reuse
